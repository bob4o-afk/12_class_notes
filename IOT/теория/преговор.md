## COAP – MESSAGE FORMAT
![COAP_MESSAGE_FORMAT](./images/pregovor2.png)

### Key Components of the COAP Message Format:
1. **Version (2 bits)**: Identifies the CoAP version in use.
2. **Type (2 bits)**:
   - **Confirmable (CON)**: Requires acknowledgment.
   - **Non-confirmable (NON)**: Does not require acknowledgment.
   - **Acknowledgment (ACK)**: Response to a confirmable message.
   - **Reset (RST)**: Indicates an error or that a message is not understood.

3. **Token Length (4 bits)**: Specifies the length of the token (0 to 8 bytes).
4. **Code (8 bits)**:
   - Split into two parts: `3-bit class` and `5-bit detail`.
   - Defines the method (e.g., GET, POST) or response code (e.g., 2.05 for content).
5. **Message ID (16 bits)**: Unique identifier for matching messages.
6. **Token (0 to 8 bytes)**: Used for request-response pairing.

---

## COAP – REQUEST EXAMPLE
- CoAP requests include the method (e.g., GET) and the target URI. Responses carry the status code and optional payload.

---

## COAP – PACKET LOSS
- CoAP uses retransmission mechanisms for confirmable messages to handle packet loss.
- Timeouts and exponential backoff are implemented for reliability.

---

## COAP – PACKET FORMAT
- Includes header, token, options, and payload sections.
- Compact design ensures minimal overhead for IoT devices.

---

## COAP – SUBSCRIPTION
- Supports asynchronous observation of resources.
- Clients can subscribe to resource updates using the observe option.
- Notifications are sent whenever the resource state changes.

---

## COAP – BLOCK TRANSFER
- Used for transferring large payloads in smaller chunks.
- Supports fragmentation and reassembly for constrained devices.

  - Binary format for efficiency.
  - Bidirectional communication.
  - Data agnostic.
  - Highly scalable.
  - TLS encryption for secure communication.
  - Keep-alive mechanism ensures consistent connectivity.

---

## MQTT CLIENT/BROKER CONNECTION
- **Process**:
  1. Client sends a `CONNECT` packet to the server.
   - **Contains**:
      - clientID
      - cleanSession
  2. Server responds with a `CONNACK` packet to establish the connection.
   - **Contains**:
      - sessionPresent (bool)
      - return code
- **Underlying Protocol**: TCP.


### MQTT PACKETS
1. **Client/Broker Connection**:
   - `CONNECT`: Initiates a connection to the broker.
   - `CONNACK`: Acknowledges connection establishment.

2. **MQTT Publish**:
   - `PUBLISH`: Sends data from a publisher to the broker.
    - **Contains**:
      - packetId
      - topicName
      - **qos**
      - retainFlag
      - payload (the data)
      - dupFlag

3. **MQTT Subscribe**:
   - `SUBSCRIBE`: A client subscribes to specific topics.
    - **Contains**:
      - packetId
      - {qos1, topic1...}
   - `SUBACK`: Acknowledges the subscription.
    - **Contains**:
      - packetId
      - {return code1...}

4. **MQTT Unsubscribe**:
   - `UNSUBSCRIBE`: A client unsubscribes from specific topics.
    - **Contains**:
      - packetId
      - {topic1...}
   - `UNSUBACK`: Acknowledges the unsubscription.
    - **Contains**:
      - packetId
---

## MQTT TOPICS
- **Definition**: Topics are UTF-8 strings used to filter messages for subscribers.
- **Structure**:
  - Hierarchical.
  - Levels separated by `/`.
  - Supports wildcards.

### MQTT TOPIC WILDCARDS
1. **`+` Wildcard**:
   - Represents a single level in the hierarchy.
   - Example: `home/+/temperature` matches `home/livingroom/temperature`.

2. **`#` Wildcard**:
   - Represents multiple levels in the hierarchy.
   - Example: `home/#` matches `home/livingroom/temperature` and `home/kitchen/humidity`.

### MQTT TOPIC LEVELS
- Example Hierarchy:
  - `home/kitchen/temperature`
  - `home/livingroom/humidity`
  - `office/meetingroom/light`

---

## MQTT QOS (Quality of Service)
- **Purpose**: Ensures reliable communication between parties.
- **Levels**:
  1. **QoS 0**: At most one delivery (no guarantee).
  2. **QoS 1**: At least one delivery (duplicates possible).
  3. **QoS 2**: Exactly one delivery (highest reliability).

---

## MQTT CLEAN/PERSISTENT SESSION
### Types of Sessions:
1. **Clean Session**:
   - All client data is deleted after disconnection.

2. **Persistent Session**:
   - The following data is stored after disconnection:
     - `clientID`.
     - Subscriptions.
     - Unacknowledged QoS messages.
     - Queued messages.

---

## MQTT RETAINED MESSAGES
- **Definition**: The broker stores the topic's last known value.
- **Use Case**: Ensures that new subscribers immediately receive the last retained value.
- **Purpose**: Useful when the initial state is required.

---

## MQTT LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT
- **Purpose**: Used to handle ungraceful disconnections.
- **Ungraceful Disconnect Causes**:
  - No communication within the keep-alive period.
  - I/O error or network failure.
  - No `DISCONNECT` packet sent before closing the connection.

The broker uses the Last Will message to notify other clients about the disconnect.
